### üì± Useful Apps:

CVLFace includes several practical apps to demonstrate and utilize the capabilities of the toolkit in real-world scenarios. Currently, there are two main applications:

#### 1. [Face Alignment App](cvlface/apps/face_alignment/README.md)
The Face Alignment App processes facial images to align them to a canonical position suitable for face recognition. This app automatically resizes the images to 112x112 pixels, optimizing them for consistent input to face recognition models.

<td><img src="cvlface/apps/face_alignment/example/aligned_images/3_ldmks.png" alt="Image 2"></td>
</tr>
</table>

#### 2. [Face Verification App](cvlface/apps/verification/README.md)
The Face Verification App verifies the identity of a person by comparing their facial image with a reference image. This app uses a pre-trained face recognition model to calculate the similarity between the two images and determine if they belong to the same person.
